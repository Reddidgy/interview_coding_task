## What is it

This script is a Python terminal management tool that allows you to interact with your system via a command-line interface.

I created it for Sharp Developers, the company, to make interviews more engaging :)

Challenging is getting the token to run app.py with the correct one using command

```bash
python3 app.py --token=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

### About env and token in there
It's a counterfeit token, so there's no need to worry; it resembles a Telegram token. I only required it to streamline the deployment process without involving additional business matters.
